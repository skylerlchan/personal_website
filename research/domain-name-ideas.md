## Domain Ideas by Category

### Tier 1 -- Strong Recommendations (likely available, professional, memorable)

| Domain | Why it works |
|---|---|
| **`skyler-chan.com`** | Already liked. Classic `.com` with hyphen for readability. Familiar and trustworthy TLD. |
| **`skylerchan.dev`** | `.dev` is the go-to TLD for developers. Signals tech identity immediately. Enforces HTTPS by default. Likely available. |
| **`skylerchan.com`** | The canonical option. May need to confirm registration status since the server returned a 404 (could be parked). |
| **`skyler-chan.dev`** | Combines the liked hyphenated format with the developer-focused `.dev` TLD. |

### Tier 2 -- Strong Alternatives

| Domain | Why it works |
|---|---|
| `skylerchan.io` | `.io` is hugely popular in tech/startup circles. Short, clean, and widely recognized. |
| `skylerchan.me` | `.me` is designed for personal sites. Clear "this is about me" signal. |
| `skylerchan.co` | `.co` reads like a shortened `.com`. Popular with startups and personal brands. |
| `skylerch.dev` | Abbreviated last name keeps it short. `.dev` reinforces the tech focus. |

### Tier 3 -- Creative / Niche Options

| Domain | Why it works |
|---|---|
| `skylerchan.tech` | Explicit tech signal. Good if the `.dev` and `.com` are unavailable. |
| `skylerchan.xyz` | Trendy, inexpensive TLD. Used by Alphabet (abc.xyz). Less corporate feel. |
| `skylerch.an` | Domain hack spelling out "skylerch.an" -- however, `.an` (Netherlands Antilles) was retired in 2015 and is no longer available for registration. **Not viable.** |
| `skylerchan.site` | Clean and neutral. Budget-friendly TLD. |
| `skylerchan.page` | Google-managed TLD, HTTPS enforced. Good for a single-page portfolio. |
| `skylerchan.codes` | Niche TLD that says exactly what you do. |
| `skylerchan.engineer` | Very specific professional signal. Long but distinctive. |

### Tier 4 -- Domain Hacks and Creative Plays

| Domain | Concept |
|---|---|
| `skyler.ch` | `.ch` is Switzerland's TLD. Spells out "skyler.ch" which visually reads as the start of "chan." Short and memorable. |
| `s.chan.dev` | Subdomain hack (only works if you own `chan.dev`, which is taken). |
| `hi.skylerchan.dev` | Friendly subdomain approach -- register `skylerchan.dev` and use `hi.` as the entry point. |
| `skylrc.hn` | Domain hack using Honduras TLD. Unusual but very short. |

## Recommendation

**Top pick: `skylerchan.dev`** -- It is very likely available, signals developer identity, enforces HTTPS, is reasonably priced, and uses the full name for easy discovery. Pair it with `skyler-chan.com` (already liked) as a redirect or alias for people who default to `.com`.

**Runner-up: `skyler-chan.dev`** -- If you prefer the hyphenated style consistently across TLDs.

**Budget pick: `skylerchan.xyz`** -- Cheap, likely available, and has a modern/techy vibe.
