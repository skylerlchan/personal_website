# Paradoxical Principles in LDS Standard Works

---

## 1. Gaining Strength Through Weakness or Surrender

**Ether 12:27** -- "And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them."

**2 Corinthians 12:9-10** -- "My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong."

**1 Corinthians 1:25-28** -- "Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men...But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are."

**Mosiah 3:19** -- "For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father."

**D&C 84:106** -- "And if any man among you be strong in the Spirit, let him take with him him that is weak, that he may be edified in all meekness, that he may become strong also."

**Moses 1:10** -- "Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed." Yet in verse 4, God says: "thou art my son" and in verse 6: "thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten." The paradox: man is nothing in cosmic scope, yet of infinite worth as a child of God.

**Alma 26:12** -- Ammon declares his nothingness yet boasts in God's strength: "Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things."

## 2. Finding Freedom by Serving Others

**Mosiah 2:17-18** -- "And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God. Behold, ye have called me your king; and if I, whom ye call your king, do labor to serve you, then ought not ye to labor to serve one another?"

**Mosiah 5:8** -- "Under this head ye are made free, and there is no other head whereby ye can be made free. There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh." The paradox: binding yourself to Christ through covenant is the only path to genuine freedom.

**John 8:31-36** -- "If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free...Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin...If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed." True freedom comes through discipleship and obedience, not through independence.

**Galatians 5:13** -- "For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another."

## 3. Leading Through Humility

**Matthew 23:11-12** -- "But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted."

**Matthew 20:26-28** -- "Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many."

**Mark 10:43-45** -- "Whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all. For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many."

**Luke 14:11** -- "For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted."

**Mosiah 23:7-8, 13** -- Alma refuses kingship: "It is not expedient that we should have a king; for thus saith the Lord: Ye shall not esteem one flesh above another, or one man shall not think himself above another." And: "Stand fast in this liberty wherewith ye have been made free, and that ye trust no man to be a king over you."

**Philippians 2:5-9** -- "Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name." The ultimate paradox of divine kingship: the highest Being emptied himself to the lowest station, and was therefore exalted above all.

## 4. Gaining Life by Losing It

**Matthew 10:39** -- "He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it."

**Luke 17:33** -- "Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it."

**John 12:24-25** -- "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal."

**Mosiah 27:25-26** -- "Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters; And thus they become new creatures." The old self must die for the new creature to emerge.

**2 Nephi 9:39** -- "Remember, to be carnally-minded is death, and to be spiritually-minded is life eternal."

## 5. Power Through Meekness and Gentleness

**D&C 121:41-42, 46** -- "No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile...The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever."

**D&C 121:36-37** -- "The rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness. That when we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves." The paradox: attempting to seize power causes it to vanish; relinquishing coercive control is the only way to retain true influence.

**Matthew 5:5** -- "Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth."

**3 Nephi 12:5** -- Christ to the Nephites: "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth."

**1 Nephi 1:20** -- "The tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance." Faith and tenderness produce might.

## 6. Light Coming from Darkness

**D&C 88:6, 11-13, 49** -- "He that ascended up on high, as also he descended below all things, in that he comprehended all things, that he might be in all and through all things, the light of truth...The light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things, which is the law by which all things are governed, even the power of God...The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not; nevertheless, the day shall come when you shall comprehend even God."

**D&C 93:36, 39** -- "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth...Light and truth forsake that evil one." Light does not fight darkness; it simply abandons wickedness, leaving it in isolation.

**Alma 36:20-21** -- "There can be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains...nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy." The deepest darkness of sin became the occasion for the most radiant experience of grace. Joy was proportional to the prior depth of anguish.

**D&C 19:18-19** -- "Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit -- and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink -- Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men." The greatest Being endured the deepest darkness to bring forth the greatest light.

## 7. Liberty and Agency as Core Principles

**2 Nephi 2:11** -- "For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so...righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery." Without opposition, agency is meaningless and existence itself collapses.

**2 Nephi 2:25-27** -- "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy...And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death." The Fall -- seemingly the worst event -- was the necessary precondition for joy and meaningful choice.

**2 Nephi 2:26** -- "Because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon."

**Abraham 3:25-26** -- "And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever." The test of mortality -- with its suffering and limitation -- is the mechanism for eternal advancement.

**D&C 93:30** -- "All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence." Agency is not merely a gift; it is a precondition of existence itself.

**Mosiah 23:13** -- "Stand fast in this liberty wherewith ye have been made free."

## 8. Hope Emerging from Suffering

**D&C 122:7-8** -- "All these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good. The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?"

**D&C 58:2-4** -- "Blessed is he that keepeth my commandments, whether in life or in death; and he that is faithful in tribulation, the reward of the same is greater in the kingdom of heaven. Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter, and the glory which shall follow after much tribulation. For after much tribulation come the blessings."

**D&C 98:1, 3** -- "Rejoice evermore, and in everything give thanks...all things wherewith you have been afflicted shall work together for your good, and to my name's glory."

**Romans 8:28** -- "And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose."

**James 1:2-4** -- "My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience; But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing."

**Hebrews 5:8-9** -- "Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him." Even the Son of God was perfected through suffering.

**Hebrews 12:6, 11** -- "For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth...Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby."

**D&C 105:6** -- "My people must needs be chastened until they learn obedience, if it must needs be, by the things which they suffer."

**Mosiah 24:14-15** -- "I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage...the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord." The paradox: deliverance came not by removing the bondage, but by strengthening the people within it.

**Alma 36:3** -- "Whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day."

**Alma 62:41** -- "Many had become hardened, because of the exceedingly great length of the war; and many were softened because of their afflictions, insomuch that they did humble themselves before God, even in the depth of humility." The same affliction either hardens or softens depending on the individual's response.

**Alma 7:11-12** -- "And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind...And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities." Christ suffered so he could understand and help those who suffer -- hope made possible by God's own descent into pain.

## The Beatitudes: A Concentrated Paradox

**Matthew 5:3-12 / 3 Nephi 12:3-12** -- The Beatitudes invert worldly values by promising blessings through conditions the world considers disadvantages:

- Poor in spirit --> kingdom of heaven
- Those who mourn --> comforted
- The meek --> inherit the earth
- Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness --> filled
- The merciful --> obtain mercy
- The pure in heart --> see God
- The peacemakers --> called children of God
- The persecuted --> kingdom of heaven

The 3 Nephi version adds the condition "who come unto me" to the first beatitude: "Blessed are the poor in spirit who come unto me, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."

---

## Additional Paradox: Knowledge and Humility

**2 Nephi 9:28-29** -- "When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness...But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God." Learning is good, but learning without humility before God becomes foolishness.

**Alma 32:14-16** -- Those "compelled to be humble" by circumstances are blessed, but those who "truly humble themselves because of the word" without compulsion are "much more blessed." Voluntary humility surpasses forced humility.
