  "biography": {
    "professional": "Skyler Chan is a founding engineer at WithAI Research, a Y Combinator W26 startup developing large language models specifically designed for AI-native hedge funds. His work spans the intersection of artificial intelligence, robotics, climate science, and quantitative finance. At Princeton's High Meadows Environmental Institute (HMEI), he conducted groundbreaking research on solar radiation management, discovering that stratospheric black carbon aerosols are 10x more effective at cooling than traditional reflective sulfate aerosols. Beyond his professional work, Skyler is deeply involved in robotics, having co-founded Hoverloon—a hybrid blimp-drone platform that achieved 19x payload capacity improvement through buoyant lift. He's currently building humanoid robots with SO-100 arms, exploring teleoperation as a System 1 procedure for improved autonomy and data collection.",

    "technical": "Skyler's technical expertise encompasses multiple domains: large language models and AI systems, computer vision and edge AI, robotics and embedded systems, climate modeling and data science, and quantitative finance algorithms. He has experience with production LLM systems, autonomous vehicle navigation, real-time computer vision processing, and delta-neutral trading strategies. His projects demonstrate a consistent ability to identify inefficiencies in existing systems and develop novel solutions that achieve order-of-magnitude improvements.",

    "personal": "Outside of engineering and research, Skyler is an accomplished classical pianist with a repertoire spanning Bach to contemporary composers like Hiromi. His performances demonstrate technical precision and artistic interpretation across diverse styles. He's also passionate about travel and food exploration, viewing these as opportunities to experience different cultures and perspectives. This combination of analytical thinking and creative expression shapes his approach to problem-solving—seeking elegant solutions that are both technically sound and conceptually innovative.",

    "philosophy": "Skyler's approach to work and life is encapsulated in his personal motto: 'Always building. Always thinking.' This reflects a continuous drive to create tangible solutions while maintaining deep engagement with fundamental questions. He's drawn to problems that sit at the intersection of multiple disciplines, where insights from one domain can unlock solutions in another. Whether it's applying computer vision to urban parking optimization, using climate modeling to evaluate geoengineering approaches, or building hybrid aerial vehicles that challenge assumptions about flight, Skyler seeks opportunities to rethink first principles and explore unconventional approaches."
