  "context": {
    "approach": "Skyler's education at Princeton combines rigorous technical training with hands-on project work and research. He actively seeks opportunities to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems, whether through climate research at HMEI, robotics projects at the Robotics Club, or independent ventures. His interdisciplinary interests—spanning AI, robotics, climate science, and finance—reflect a curiosity-driven approach to learning and problem-solving.",

    "philosophy": "Views education not just as knowledge acquisition but as skill-building through doing. Believes the best way to learn is to build, and actively engages in projects that push technical boundaries while addressing meaningful problems."
