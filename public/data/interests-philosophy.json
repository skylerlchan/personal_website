  "philosophy": {
    "motto": "Always building. Always thinking.",

    "meaningOfMotto": {
      "alwaysBuilding": "Bias toward action and creation. Learning happens through making things real. Better to build an imperfect prototype than to endlessly plan. Ship early, iterate often, and let real-world feedback guide development.",

      "alwaysThinking": "While building fast is important, thoughtful consideration matters too. Take time to understand first principles, question assumptions, and consider alternative approaches. The best solutions come from balancing action with reflection.",

      "balance": "The motto represents a tension between doing and thinking that both pushes forward and questions direction. Build to learn what works, think to understand why and what's next."

    "workPhilosophy": {
      "onBuilding": "Build things that matter. Life's too short to work on problems you don't care about or solutions that won't see real use.",

      "onLearning": "The best education is self-directed building. Courses and books provide foundation, but real learning happens through struggling with actual problems.",

      "onExpertise": "Deep expertise in one area is valuable, but so is breadth across many areas. Sometimes the best robotics solution comes from understanding climate modeling, or the best ML system design comes from finance experience.",

      "onFailure": "Most projects don't work out as planned. That's fine - the learning is in the journey. Ship things, learn what doesn't work, iterate.",

      "onCollaboration": "Best work happens through collaboration with people who have different perspectives and expertise. Open source and knowledge sharing make everyone better."
