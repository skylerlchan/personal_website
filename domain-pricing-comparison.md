## .io Domain Pricing

| Registrar | 1st Year | Renewal/yr | WHOIS Privacy | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Porkbun** | **$28.12** (sale) | $51.80 | Free | Confirmed from site. Best promo price found. |
| **Dynadot** | **$28.89** | $53.50 | Free | Confirmed from site. Strong first-year price. |
| **Cloudflare** | ~$44-48 (at-cost) | Same as reg | Free | At-cost (no markup). Price = wholesale registry fee. Cannot register new domains without existing CF account with a domain. |
| **Namecheap** | ~$32-35 | ~$52-55 | Free 1st yr, then ~$3/yr | Blocked by 403; based on known Namecheap .io pricing range. |
| **GoDaddy** | ~$49-60 | ~$60-80 | Extra ~$10-20/yr | Blocked by 403; GoDaddy is typically the most expensive. Aggressive upsells. |
| **Hover** | ~$50-55 | ~$50-55 | Free | Blocked; Hover is known for transparent pricing, no hidden fees, but generally not the cheapest. |
| **Squarespace** | ~$50-60 | ~$50-60 | Free | Inherited Google Domains pricing. Generally mid-to-high range. |
| **Name.com** | ~$54 (sale from $80) | ~$60-80 | Extra ~$5/yr | Confirmed sale pricing of $53.99, regular $79.99. |
| **Gandi** | ~$31 (EUR 28.99 promo) | ~$70 (EUR 64.99) | Free | Confirmed from site. Cheap first year but very expensive renewal. |

### .io Verdict
**Cheapest first year:** Porkbun ($28.12) or Dynadot ($28.89)
**Cheapest long-term:** Cloudflare (~$44-48/yr, at-cost) if you can get in; otherwise Porkbun ($51.80/yr renewal) or Dynadot ($53.50/yr renewal) are comparable.

## Overall Recommendations

### Best Overall: Porkbun
- Cheapest first-year pricing for both .io ($28.12) and .me ($3.94)
- Competitive renewal rates ($51.80 for .io, $17.27 for .me)
- Free WHOIS privacy, SSL, URL forwarding, email forwarding included
- Well-regarded in the developer community

### Best Long-Term Value: Cloudflare Registrar
- At-cost pricing with zero markup
- No upsells, no surprise renewal hikes
- Free WHOIS privacy
- **Limitation:** You need an active Cloudflare account; some users report you must first register/transfer a domain elsewhere, then transfer to Cloudflare (they don't always support new registrations for all TLDs directly)

### Best Runner-Up: Dynadot
- Second-cheapest first-year pricing confirmed
- Transparent renewal rates
- Free WHOIS privacy
- Clean, no-nonsense interface

### Avoid for These TLDs
- **Gandi**: Great first-year promos but renewal prices are 2-3x higher than competitors
- **GoDaddy**: Consistently most expensive, charges extra for WHOIS privacy, aggressive upselling
- **Name.com**: High regular pricing for .io ($79.99), even sale price ($53.99) is more expensive than competitors

## Key Notes

1. **Domain availability** for skylerchan.io and skylerchan.me could not be confirmed via automated checks (registrar search APIs blocked). You'll need to search manually -- both are uncommon enough names that they are very likely available.

2. **Transfer strategy**: Register at the cheapest first-year price (Porkbun), then after the mandatory 60-day lock period, transfer to Cloudflare for at-cost renewals if you want the lowest long-term cost.

3. **WHOIS privacy** is free at Porkbun, Dynadot, Cloudflare, Hover, and Squarespace. GoDaddy and Name.com charge extra ($5-20/yr), which significantly impacts total cost.

4. **ICANN fee**: Most registrars add an $0.18/yr ICANN fee on top. Cloudflare includes it in their at-cost price.

5. **.io TLD note**: The .io registry (Identity Digital, formerly donuts/Afilias) has been raising wholesale prices. Expect .io renewal prices across all registrars to continue climbing.
